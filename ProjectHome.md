**Sruthi7 Beta Pre-Test version 7.36**

---

This is the basic pre-beta version for compatibility check of video playback with Codec-Packs in Windows7. The Sruthi Plugin component and Audio-Lab is disabled in this release. But the audio playback is still supported without any effects, visualization and equalizer.

Drag-drop a video file over the window to play. If you come across a file that hangs Sruthi or closes the program unexpectedly, plz tell me abt it at nvn.smp@gmail.com. Please note the error message if any, file format played and the operation you performed that leads to the trigger of the error.

This version relies exclusively on the Aero architecture of windows7. So it may not work on previous versions of windows or Windows7 with aero theme disabled. The alternative basic mode will be implemented.

**Why Sruthi ?**

---

SRUTHI was born in year 1999 as a bare simple audio player for Windows98. I used modify the code it at my free time just to learn the coding techniques. I used to implement every feature of the best media players available, in just pure VB.

Even after I migrated to .net, Sruthi was left on VB6. Visual Basic 6 was once the most loved language and IDE worldwide. But the classic VB was ignored and abandoned by Microsoft for the marketing reasons of .Net platform. All the VB developers were asked to migrate to the .Net platform and learn the new VB.net rules.

.net evolved many generations and become powerful platform for windows application development, but the love for VB6 never left the hearts of the developers.The story goes on and promising OS Windows 7 was introduced by Microsoft after Vista. Win7 was better than all the previous versions with performance and hardware assisted user-interface. It came with tons of underlying features which could be implemented only by the use of the latest Visual Studio IDE.

Sruthi is an attempt to use all the ui features offered by the windows7 without using any of the .net frameworks and tools. Sruthi was recoded from scratch in pure classic VB6 with COM as a symbol of love for the classic vb and a petition to Microsoft for the development of unmanaged Visual Basic.
